          h3 Advantages of Visiting a Barber
          p A barber knows how to cut men’s hair. If you’re like most men these days, you’re probably going to some unisex chain salon. Most of the time, you’d walk out of these places with an average haircut. Sometimes, such a haircut would look decent for the first week or so, but then it would grow out into a horrible bowl. The problem is that many of the people who work at salons are not trained barbers. They’re cosmetologists. The difference between the two can spell the difference between a good-looking haircut and a great one.
          p A barber is trained to cut with clippers, the main tool in cutting men’s hair. Cosmetologists, on the other hand, are trained to use scissors. Their training is also geared towards catering to women’s hair. They are experts in styling, coloring, and perming — things a man has no need for. That’s why when you ask the cute stylist at a unisex salon to use the number 2 on the clippers, you walk away with a bad haircut. She’s probably not well versed in how to use them. But a barber can employ the clippers with finesse. Barber is also a guy who also has some interesting stories and who can be a perfect listener. You won’t meet a hairdresser with such a skill in other salons these days.

          h3 Conclusion
          p Every time you go to the barber shop, you’ll just feel manlier. It’s hard to tell what it really is. Perhaps it’s the combination of the smell of hair tonics and the all-man atmosphere. But more so, it’s the awareness of the tradition of barbershops. Barbershops are places of continuity; they don’t change with the shifts in culture. The places and barbers look the same as they did when your dad got his hair cut. It’s a straightforward experience with none of the accouterments of the modern age. There are no waxings, facials, highlights, or appointments. Just great haircuts and great conversations.
